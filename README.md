# Registration-Form

Here you can find a simple registration form made for vefskolinn course
It was created for both Accessibility and JavaScript Form guides

The registration form takes several inputs:

- Full Name
- Phone Number
- Email Address
- Password
- Confirm Password

## Form Validation

In this registration form, I've used two types of validation

### HTML Validation

Thanks to the use of HTML built-in form validation I could make this form work easily.
I've just passed different required values and patterns to display the errors to the user if something was wrong.
You can read about the built-in HTML validation over here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation

Here also you can find all the elements used for the input tag in HTML:

### JavaScript Form Validation

Using vanilla JavaScript I build a bit more complex registration form validator
code is explained block by block in the script.js file.
registration button click starts the function that precisely checks if each input was filled correctly according to the set pattern.
Each error is displayed underneath the input border.
